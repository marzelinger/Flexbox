# Flexbox

## The Goal

Now that you've learned the in and outs of CSS Grid, you may think you've found the solution to all of your layout needs. But, as all of your favorite infomercials will tell you... there's more! Flexbox is a great way to easily achieve **one dimensional** layouts.

## The Lab
In this lab we'll start by looking at some of the core concepts of Flexbox and how to use them in our websites. By the end of the lab you'll create a Navigation bar using flexbox as an example of a one dimensional layout that is sometimes easier to create with Flexbox than with Grid.

* flex property in individual items

#### Task Three:

Topics:
* display: flex

* flex property in individual items
* justify - content
* align content

#### Task Four: Navbar

Nested flexbox --> have the flexbox items have text/images in them, create a row out of the items and then center the text


#### Stretch

<!-- does it make sense to have the navbar elements have text, then have them use flex to center that text within the items as well? maybe as a stretch "nested flexbox" should that be a stetch?-->
